# Working notes / dev diary

- [Blog post on DEV.to](https://dev.to/andypiper/a-quick-glitch-bio-break-1c6a)

## Changes from the default Glitch in Bio template

- custom theme/style (`dusky-lory.css`)
  - used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) to make a palette
  - imported a Google Fonts resource
- using [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) to get my profile image
  - convenient, as it also lets me get resized versions with `?s=` URL params
- fixed `head.html` to _correctly_ include `og` and `twitter` meta tags
  - Twitter Card Validator fails on the default template as-is
  - NOTE: need a minimum of (either `og:` or `twitter:`) `title` and `image` to work; looks best with `description` as well
  - also added `og:type` so that other site embeds should work, not just Twitter
- added ld+json Person data to the page (see `layout/json-ld`)
- added a short bio blurb to `settings.json` -> para markup in `index.html`
- added Stack Overflow, Ko-fi, GitLab icons to `social.html` footer
  - used SVGs from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)
- borrowed [Tweet links](https://glitch.com/~tweet-links) template, updated to use timelines as well as Tweets and customised params to match theme
- I decided I wanted a different image for the favicon/homescreen icon than on the page itself, so I added `avatarImageAlt` to settings
  - and, then added a CSS opacity mouseover effect to fade between them (in `avatar.html` and `style.css` so this is independent of theme)
- excluded `.md` files from restart in `watch.json`
- added a custom domain (andypiper.me) using the [support article](https://help.glitch.com/kb/article/9-how-do-i-add-a-custom-domain-to-my-glitch-project/)
  - also, took the opportunity to update the security on my registrar login with 2FA, and to let some old/unneeded domains expire! #cleanup
  - nice thing, Hover includes Glitch on the dashboard for connecting domains, so this was super easy.
    - Glitch docs do not reference Hover as a registrar with direct integration
- added a new settings value, `favicon`, and updated the `head.html` to use this
  - again used the Gravatar URL for this
- changed the Remix in Glitch button in `footer.html` so that it remixes this project, rather than the `glitch-in-bio` template
  - wondering, is this "the done thing?"
    - on one hand, the end developer actually gets to inherit the changes I made
    - on the other hand, I've based this on a template, so maybe that's the best starting point
- Glitch "Add CoC" button in editor does not add a useful (to my project) CoC, but I would like to apply something relevant
  - turns out that it is the [Citizen CoC](https://web.archive.org/web/20200330154000/http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) which is OK, but refers to e.g. events, and needs manual customisation
  - -> _added Contributor Covenant as CoC for this project_
- merged updates to the core template 2021-11-30
  - `description` meta in header
  - new social icons
  - alt text for image links (a11y++, nice)
  - fixed CSS social icons hover
  - added `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file
- added social.lol status as a separate embed

## TODO / ideas

- ~~move away from Google Fonts (EU law issue)~~ -> https://fonts.coollabs.io/
- ~~add Tweet timeline~~
  - make it collapsible?
- ~~change favicon to match site~~
- add Mastodon embed support
- [X] add PixelFed and Diode and Bookwyrm social links 
- [X] add lastFM and Traktv social links
- add ~~Revue~~ and BitBucket social links (edit social template)
- add IRC/Libera Chat/Matrix/Discord social link
- consider a full [Ko-fi button or widget](https://ko-fi.com/Manage/donation-widget-setup)
- refactor the SVGs out from the `social` template to make it cleaner
- ~~social icon for GitLab~~
- ~~twemoji plugin (scratchpad below, but as this is, it messes with alignment)~~
  - ~~nice to have because it means you have the same emoji on all platforms~~
  - ~~could also just put them in as images in the list items _shrug_~~
  - ~~also twemoji are CC-BY-4.0 -> attribution req'd if used~~
- podcast / audio player plugin to unfold from the Podcast button? listed in page?
  - could point to latest episode, using the podcast RSS
- ~~make the `avatarImageAlt` a mouseover effect?~~
- I'd quite like some stats of some kind to gauge vists / what content gets attention
- ~~check WCAG stuff for a11y~~ changed contrast of palette
- build more themes
  - check contrast when choosing palette
- Gravatar improvement: if the user adds an email address to settings, generate the Gravatar URL (it is the MD5 hash of an email address)
- a corner "(i)" icon with a popover to explain what this is / how it was made
- make the "by way of introduction" a collapsible embedded Toot
- highlighted code projects


### docs

- update the `README.md` file so it reflects this remix project, not only the general Glitch in Bio template
- ~~I don't really need that `CHANGELOG.md` file since it is from pre-remix~~
  - deleted it
- the `LICENSE` looks like it is specific to vite-plugin-react... (hmm, wonder how best to handle licenses in the context of remixes etc)

(thought, as I continue to poke... this is addictive... need to think about curating a list like this to keep it fresh, relevant, and useful)

I was thinking about embedding YT content etc but want to keep it simple

~~Digging around in Vite, looks like Vite 2.7 will enable `server.fs.deny` so that the markdown and other files can avoid being served.~~

^^^ this was probably my mistake in thinking those files were being served from the app in 2.5/2.6, seems to only let me hit the index page now, which is what I want.

... I finally cracked, and added more social links to the footer; but, now I'm wondering whether I should limit that list?

- page was constantly reloading. Checked the logs and found: a vite error with websocket connection on 443, so disabled that option in vite config; a node version error, downgraded to 14.x

## Code scratchpad

```text
<!-- twemoji -->
<script
  src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/twemoji.min.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
<!-- render emojis as Twemoji -->
<script>
  window.onload = function() {
    // Parses the document body and
    // inserts <img> tags in place of Unicode Emojis
    twemoji.parse(
      document.body,
      { folder: "svg", ext: ".svg" } // This is to specify to Twemoji to use SVGs and not PNGs
    );
  };
</script>

<!-- CSS configurations to tweak how the Twemojis are displayed -->
<style>
img.emoji {
   transform: scale(0.5);
   height: 0.5em;
   width: 0.5em;
   margin: 0 .05em 0 .1em;
   vertical-align: -0.5em;
   pointer-events: none;
  }
</style>
```
