## Direct traffic to your own Glitch-in-bio app in 3 steps:

### 1. Remix this app for your own, live version in seconds

Then click **Preview** at the bottom of this window and then **Preview in new window** to see the live app in its own window, with a free `glitch.me` domain ready to share. 

üìù _Make sure to log into Glitch to save your new app or else it will expire in 5 days._


### 2. Edit `settings.json` to add your own info and links

Replace the meta info, links and social sites we added for you in `settings.json` and you'll see your changes instantly updated in real time! 

If you want to include images, upload them in `assets` and copy the URLs into your settings JSON too‚Äì_make sure you have a theme selected that shows images like `gallery` or `menu`_.


### 3. Choose a theme

To help you make the site your own we've included some themes. In `settings.json` you can enter `glitch`, `gallery`, or `menu` as the value for `theme`. 

üìù  _If you want to see how these themes are made, look in the `public/styles/themes` directory! If you don't have a valid theme entered, the site will default to the styles outlined in `style.css`._

### ...or create your own!

Customize your site by updating `custom-theme.css` inside the `public/styles/themes` folder with CSS to update colors, fonts, or any other style rules. Update your `theme` in `settings.json` to `custom-theme` to have the app use those new rules.

üìù _You can rename `custom-theme.css`, just make sure you use the new file name as your theme value in `settings.json`._

üñºÔ∏è Check out examples of other themes the community has created in [this Playlist](https://glitch.com/@glitch/featured-glitch-in-bio-remixes) and [submit your own](https://forms.gle/9WFWjSmhdiEoRgVs5) to share!

## Other Tips & tricks

Get **verified** links by adding `rel="me"` to your anchor tags in `layout/social.html` like this for Mastodon:

```
<!-- Mastodon -->
{{#if settings.social.mastodon}}
<a
  aria-label="{{settings.name}} on Mastodon"
  href="{{settings.social.mastodon}}"
  tabindex="-1"
  rel="me"
>
```

* Check out the [Glitch-in-bio section of our Help Center](https://help.glitch.com/kb/section/13/) for more documentation on how to customize or troubleshoot your new app!
* If you notice your preview is a little out of sync with your `settings.json`, hit the reload button in the preview window and it should update!
* Looking for ways to extend your app, or for inspiration? Check out the official [Glitch-in-bio page](https://glitch.com/glitch-in-bio).

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file. You can delete it, or keep it handy so you don't lose the instructions.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main page template vite uses to build your site. You'll see the handlebars syntax for importing the data you specify in `settings.json` (built into the structures in `layout/`). You'll also find some tips on configuring the page in the HTML comments.

‚Üê `settings.json`: Settings for your name, links, images, and social media. The `index.html` page includes the data using the structures defined in `layout/`.

‚Üê `layout/`: Markup templates ‚Äî you can edit every line of HTML or never even look at any of it. The data you specify in `settings.json` will be built into the page using the HTML in here using handlebars syntax (e.g. `{{settings.name}}`).

‚Üê `public/styles/`: Stylesheets for Glitch in Bio, including alternate themes. Change your theme in `settings.json`. You can create a new theme by adding a CSS file to this folder and specifying it using its name in the settings (e.g. `glitch`, `gallery`, `menu`, or whatever yours is called!)

‚Üê `public/manifest.json` and `public/sw.js`: These set your site up to function as a Progressive Web App (PWA)‚Äìif you add new assets (e.g. stylesheets) you can include them in the list in `sw.js` to cache your site for offline viewing.

‚Üê `assets`: Add images here and copy the links into `settings.json` to show them in your site.
