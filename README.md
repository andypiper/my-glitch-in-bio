# Hello Links!

TBD

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file. You can delete it, or keep it handy so you don't lose the instructions.

← `index.html`: This is the main page template vite uses to build your site. 

← `settings.json`: Settings for your name, image, and links.

← `layout/`: 

← `styles/`: Stylesheets for Hello Links, including alternate themes.

### Working with Hello Links

← `src/index.jsx`: This is the root of your React app. If you add libraries like [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com) or [redux](https://react-redux.js.org), you'll insert their providers here. The `<HelmetProvider`> is an example of a provider you'd use.

← `src/app.jsx`: The base for your react app, here is where the magic really happens.

← `src/pages/`: Pages to import to the router should go here!

← `src/styles`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. You have [a lot of](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) importing options for CSS including CSS modules if that's your jam.
